### What I learned

i used to learn web development from react library using vite with tailwind css as layout tools. This is the first time i use tailwind with HTML. i learn using node and install tailwind througn CLI from scratch to be able to use it in HTML.

This is also the first time i upload my solution in github pages. Previously i submit the solution in netlify.

### Continued development

Continue to practice my CSS skill to be able to get the result faster and responsive
